This is a small project of mine in which I hope to make a public website that displays various data about a given ticker.

In this project I used the p5.js JavaScript library to visualize and all around run the program. The API used was polygon.io, more information below. For the future I hope to add more features for the user and compute some of my own data (averages/trends of given stocks).

Polygon.io: https://polygon.io/
